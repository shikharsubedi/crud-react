# CRUD operations with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


##  Prerequisite 
This project demonstrates CRUD operations using react. This requires a [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to be setup with one collection of streams. the `db.json` file should look  like this:

```js
{
"streams": []
}
```

After you setup the json server in a  folder and start the server with `json-server --watch  db.json` from the command line, your server should be ready to work with.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
